The following sections look at the built spectrometer from a user's point of view. The first \refsec{user-perspective} describes the assembly and operation of the spectrometer. The following \refsec{water-signal} discusses how to measure a signal with water as a simple and approachable example.

\section{The spectrometer from a user's perspective}
\labsec{user-perspective}
The spectrometer was designed with ease of use and reconfigurability in mind. The individual parts are placed on separate boards, connected with standard \acrshort{sma} connectors. Broken parts can thus be easily exchanged. Old already existing parts can be used in conjunction with newly developed ones, facilitating the re-use of hardware and ensuring operation while a broken part is fixed or upgraded.

The software -- while still incomplete -- has the same goals as the hardware. It's written in \gls{python} with extensive documentation, comments throughout the code and accompanying guides to get started\sidenote{Take a look at the official \lstinline{README.md} in the \href{https://gitlab.ethz.ch/mstabel/nmr-spectrometer/-/tree/master/software/spectrometer}{official repository}}. Generally, the code tries to adhere to the ideas presented in \enquote{Uncle Bob's} book \textit{Clean Code} \sidecite{martinCleanCodeHandbook2008}.

There are five main parts to the spectrometer as explained in \nrefch{concepts}:
\begin{description}
    \item[The console] (i.e. the RedPitaya) responsible for sending, receiving and processing the \acrshort{rf} signals.
    \item[The power amplifiers] responsible for amplifying the signal generated by the console
    \item[The transmit-receive switch] responsible for switching between sending a signal into the probe from the transmit channel and receiving a signal back from the probe into the receive channel
    \item[The probe] consisting of the probe holder and the probe coil, responsible for emitting and receiving the \acrshort{rf} signal
    \item[The \acrlong{lna}s] responsible for amplifying the weak signal received by the probe before feeding it to the console for processing
\end{description}
The short conceptual overview is reproduced in figure \reffig{overview} for the reader's convenience.
