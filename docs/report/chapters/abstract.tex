\acrfull{nmr} is a widely used analytical technique in various fields including drug screening, structural analysis and tomography. Financial hurdles prevent the Global South from profiting from this tool --- a limiting factor in medicine, chemistry and physics research.
This thesis describes the design, characterization, construction and usage of an open-source low-cost low-field easy-to-build portable NMR spectrometer from off-the-shelf and readily available components capable of spectroscopic measurements. Care has been taken to use inexpensive parts (\approx{}\qty{9}{kCHF} magnet, \approx{}\qty{1}{kCHF} electronics), open-source software and tools available in most workshops. Controlled through a simple cross-platform Python package it is easily extensible and modifiable. It provides a starting point for further development and contributes to the efforts of providing easy access to NMR technologies worldwide.
