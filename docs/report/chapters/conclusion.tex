Parts have been developed separately for easy reconfiguration and experimentation. A final design could be integrated on a single \acrshort{pcb}, reducing cost by at least another \approx50CHF as well as noise due to a shorter path and raising signal power due to fewer reflections and impedance mismatches.

The tuning and matching of the probe should be made possible from outside the magnet for easier and quicker operation.

With the recently increasing focus on low-field low-cost magnetic resonance work leveraging the higher capabilities and lower costs of modern electronics --- especially in the \acrshort{sdr} domain --- a joint effort and interface would be highly advantageous. Many homebrew NMR console control software solutions exist, most rudimentary and not compatible with other works. While software for analysing spectra exist, processing spectra can be cumbersome not only due to the various file formats, but also due the focus of existing tools on Bruker and Varian systems which often provide proprietary processing options.
