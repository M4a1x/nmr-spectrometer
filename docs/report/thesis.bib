  abstract = {The goal of this book is to provide an introduction to the practical use of mobile NMR at a level as basic as the operation of a smart phone. Each description follows the same didactic pattern: introduction, basic theory, pulse sequences and parameters, beginners-level measurements, advanced-level measurements, and data processing. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most popular method for chemists to analyze molecular structures while Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool for medical doctors that provides high-contrast images of biological tissue depicting the brain function and the beating heart. In both applications large super-conducting magnets are employed which magnetize atomic nuclei of an object positioned inside the magnet. Their circulating motion is interrogated by radio-frequency waves. Depending on the operating mode, the frequency spectrum provides the chemist with molecular information, the medical doctor with anatomic images, while the materials scientist is interested in NMR relaxation parameters, which scale with material properties and determine the contrast in magnetic resonance images. Recent advances in magnet technology led to a variety of small permanent magnets, by which NMR spectra, images, and relaxation parameters can be measured with mobile and low-cost instruments.},

  abstract = {Ultra-low cost, general purpose electronics boards featuring microprocessors or field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) are reaching capabilities sufficient for direct implementation of NMR spectrometers. We demonstrate a spectrometer based on such a board, implemented with a minimal need for the addition of custom electronics and external components. This feature allows such a spectrometer to be readily implemented using typical knowledge present in an NMR laboratory. With FPGA technology, digital tasks are performed with precise timing, without the limitation of predetermined hardware function. In this case, the FPGA is used for programming of arbitrarily timed pulse sequence events, and to digitally generate required frequencies. Data acquired from a 0.53T permanent magnet serves as a demonstration of the flexibility of pulse programming for diverse experiments. Pulse sequences applied include a spin–lattice relaxation measurement using a pulse train with small-flip angle pulses, and a Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill experiment with phase cycle. Mixing of NMR signals with a digitally generated, 4-step phase-cycled reference frequency is further implemented to achieve sequential quadrature detection. The flexibility in hardware implementation permits tailoring this type of spectrometer for applications such as relaxometry, polarimetry, diffusometry or NMR based magnetometry.},

The system is based on UNIX pipes, which allow programs running simultaneously to exchange streams of data under user control. In an NMRPipe processing scheme, a stream of spectral data flows through a pipeline of processing programs, each of which performs one component of the overall scheme, such as Fourier transformation or linear prediction. Complete multidimensional processing schemes are constructed as simple UNIX shell scripts. The processing modules themselves maintain and exploit accurate records of data sizes, detection modes, and calibration information in all dimensions, so that schemes can be constructed without the need to explicitly define or anticipate data sizes or storage details of real and imaginary channels during processing. The asynchronous pipeline scheme provides other substantial advantages, including high flexibility, favorable processing speeds, choice of both all-in-memory and disk-bound processing, easy adaptation to different data formats, simpler software development and maintenance, and the ability to distribute processing tasks on multi-CPU computers and computer networks.},

The method consists of applying a sequence of short rf pulses to the sample to be investigated and Fourier-transforming the response of the system. The main advantages of this technique compared with the usual spectral sweep method are the much shorter time required to record a spectrum and the higher inherent sensitivity. It is shown theoretically and experimentally that it is possible to enhance the sensitivity of high resolution proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a restricted time up to a factor of ten or more. The time necessary to achieve the same sensitivity is a factor of 100 shorter than with conventional methods. The enhancement of the sensitivity is essentially given by the square root of the ratio of line width to total width of the spectrum. The method is of particular advantage for complicated high resolution spectra with much fine structure.},

The quantum theory of nuclear magnets is presented within a strong physical framework, supported by figures.  The book assumes only a basic knowledge of complex numbers and matrices, and provides the reader with numerous worked examples and exercises to encourage understanding. With the explicit aim of carefully developing the subject from the beginning, the text starts with coverage of quarks and nucleons and progresses through to a detailed explanation of several important NMR experiments, including NMR imaging, COSY, NOESY and TROSY. Completely revised and updated, the Second Edition features new material on the properties and distributions of isotopes, chemical shift anisotropy and quadrupolar interactions, Pake patterns, spin echoes, slice selection in NMR imaging, and a complete new chapter on the NMR spectroscopy of quadrupolar nuclei. New appendices have been included on Euler angles, and coherence selection by field gradients. As in the first edition, all material is heavily supported by graphics, much of which is new to this edition. Written for undergraduates and postgraduate students taking a first course in NMR spectroscopy and for those needing an up-to-date account of the subject, this multi-disciplinary book will appeal to chemical, physical, material, life, medical, earth and environmental scientists. The detailed physical insights will also make the book of interest for experienced spectroscopists and NMR researchers. • An accessible and carefully written introduction, designed to help students to fully understand this complex and dynamic subject• Takes a multi-disciplinary approach, focusing on basic principles and concepts rather than the more practical aspects• Presents a strong pedagogical approach throughout, with emphasis placed on individual spins to aid understanding• Includes numerous worked examples, problems, further reading and additional notesPraise from the reviews of the First Edition:"This is an excellent book... that many teachers of NMR spectroscopy will cherish...

  abstract = {High-field FT-NMR is a high performance spectroscopic technique that is essential in many analytical fields. The non-destructive nature of NMR makes it a preferred means of analyzing chemical and biological environments. Compact NMR benchtop spectrometers are low-cost alternatives to conventional high field and high resolution spectrometers). A research laboratory may want to develop its own compact FT-NMR spectrometer ("Benchtop Home-Built NMR") with a reduced financial cost. But why? First of all, to use it punctually as an additional channel (nucleus X) to a high-resolution spectrometer, but also to be able to couple it with other with other Physics experiments such as an optical microscope to study spin diffusion in semiconductors, for instance. In addition, a "Home-Built" NMR can be used with a low-field permanent magnet for the quantification of species that does not necessarily require high-resolution, avoiding the need for weekly and expensive cryogenic services. Outside the research laboratory, this portable NMR can be used for the in situ analysis of outdoor natural environments. Finally, this compact spectrometer is naturally dedicated to the teaching of NMR technique and is open to the study of the basic electronic functions that constitute an NMR spectrometer. The main question then arises: How to build a robust "HomeBuilt” NMR? In this article, we describe the realization of an NMR instrument based on electronic components and boards (LNA, ADC, FPGA, ARM, DDS...) easily commercially available, and allowing to obtain a benchtop NMR instrument presenting both a high acquisition dynamics and a good signal-to-noise ratio.},

  abstract = {Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.  Noted software expert Robert C. Martin, presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin, who has helped bring agile principles from a practitioner’s point of view to tens of thousands of programmers, has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of software craftsman, and make you a better programmer―but only if you work at it.  What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code―lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.   Clean Codeis divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code―of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.  Readers will come away from this book understanding  How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development What “smells” and heuristics can help you identify bad codeThis book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.},

  abstract = {Citations are important building blocks for status and success in science. We used a linked dataset of more than 4 million authors and 26 million scientific papers to quantify trends in cumulative citation inequality and concentration at the author level. Our analysis, which spans 15 y and 118 scientific disciplines, suggests that a small stratum of elite scientists accrues increasing citation shares and that citation inequality is on the rise across the natural sciences, medical sciences, and agricultural sciences. The rise in citation concentration has coincided with a general inclination toward more collaboration. While increasing collaboration and full-count publication rates go hand in hand for the top 1\% most cited, ordinary scientists are engaging in more and larger collaborations over time, but publishing slightly less. Moreover, fractionalized publication rates are generally on the decline, but the top 1\% most cited have seen larger increases in coauthored papers and smaller relative decreases in fractional-count publication rates than scientists in the lower percentiles of the citation distribution. Taken together, these trends have enabled the top 1\% to extend its share of fractional- and full-count publications and citations. Further analysis shows that top-cited scientists increasingly reside in high-ranking universities in western Europe and Australasia, while the United States has seen a slight decline in elite concentration. Our findings align with recent evidence suggesting intensified international competition and widening author-level disparities in science.},

  abstract = {In recent years, permanent magnet-based NMR spectrometers have resurfaced as low-cost portable alternatives to superconducting instruments. While the development of these devices as well as clever shimming methods have yielded impressive advancements, scaling the size of these magnets to miniature lengths remains a problem to be addressed. Here we present the results of a study of a discrete shimming scheme for NMR Mandhalas constructed from a set of individual magnet blocks. While our calculations predict a modest reduction in field deviation by a factor of 9.3 in the case of the shimmed ideal Mandhala, a factor of 28 is obtained in the case of the shimmed imperfect Mandhala. This indicates that imperfections of magnet blocks can lead to improved field homogeneity. We also present a new algorithm to improve the homogeneity of a permanent magnet assembly. Strategies for future magnet construction can improve the agreement between simulation and practical implementation by using data from real magnets in these assemblies as the input to such an algorithm to optimize the homogeneity of a given design.},

  abstract = {NMR is a widely used analytical technique with a growing number of repositories available. As a result, demands for a vendor-agnostic, open data format for long-term archiving of NMR data have emerged with the aim to ease and encourage sharing, comparison, and reuse of NMR data. Here we present nmrML, an open XML-based exchange and storage format for NMR spectral data. The nmrML format is intended to be fully compatible with existing NMR data for chemical, biochemical, and metabolomics experiments. nmrML can capture raw NMR data, spectral data acquisition parameters, and where available spectral metadata, such as chemical structures associated with spectral assignments. The nmrML format is compatible with pure-compound NMR data for reference spectral libraries as well as NMR data from complex biomixtures, i.e., metabolomics experiments. To facilitate format conversions, we provide nmrML converters for Bruker, JEOL and Agilent/Varian vendor formats. In addition, easy-to-use Web-based spectral viewing, processing, and spectral assignment tools that read and write nmrML have been developed. Software libraries and Web services for data validation are available for tool developers and end-users. The nmrML format has already been adopted for capturing and disseminating NMR data for small molecules by several open source data processing tools and metabolomics reference spectral libraries, e.g., serving as storage format for the MetaboLights data repository. The nmrML open access data standard has been endorsed by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI), and we here encourage user participation and feedback to increase usability and make it a successful standard.},

  author = {Suzuki, Masatsugu and Suzuki, Itsuko},
  date = {2011-03-04},
  abstract = {Spin echo method is one of the elegant and most useful features in pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In the Phys.427, 429 (Senior laboratory) and Phys.527 (Graduate laboratory) of Binghamton University (we call simply Advanced laboratory hereafter), both undergraduate and graduate students studies the longitudinal relaxation time T 1 and the transverse relaxation time T 2 of mineral oil and water solution of CuSO4 using the spin echo method. The instrument we use in the Advanced laboratory is a TeachSpin PS1-A, a pulsed NMR apparatus. It focuses on the spin echo method using the CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) sequence with the combinations of 90 and 180 pulses for the measurement of T 1 and T 2 . Through these studies students will understand the fundamental physics underlying in NMR. From a theoretical view point, the dynamics of nuclear spins is uniquely determined by the Bloch equation. This equations are formed of the first order differential equations. The solutions of these equations with appropriate initial conditions can be exactly solved. The motions of the nuclear spin during the application of the 90 pulse and 180 pulse for the Carr-Purcell (CP) sequence, and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence, can be visualized using the Mathematica. Here we present a lecture note on the principle of the spin echo method in pulsed NMR, which has been given in the class of the Advanced laboratory. This note may be useful to students who start to do the spin echo experiment of pulsed NMR in the Advanced laboratory. One of the authors (MS) has been teaching the Advanced Laboratory course since 2005. He observes very carefully how the students come to understand the principle of the spin echo method and subsequently succeed in doing their experiment. Our students of this course obtained a lot of nice data during the classes. Typical data obtained by them are also shown for T 1 and T 2 measurements for the samples of mineral oil and water solution of CuSO 4 . It is our hope that this note may be useful to their understanding of the underlying physics. Note that the authors are not an expert of the research using the NMR measurements in the condensed matter physics. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Felix Bloch (October 23, 1905 – September 10, 1983) was a Swiss physicist, working mainly in the U.S. Bloch was born in Zürich, Switzerland to Jewish parents Gustav and Agnes Bloch. He was educated there and at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, also in Zürich. Initially studying engineering he soon changed to physics. During this time he attended lectures and seminars given by Peter Debye and Hermann Weyl at ETH Zürich and Erwin Schrödinger at the neighboring University of Zürich. A fellow student in these seminars was John von Neumann. Graduating in 1927 he continued his physics studies at the University of Leipzig with Werner Heisenberg, gaining his doctorate in 1928. His doctoral thesis established the quantum theory of solids, using Bloch waves to describe the electrons.},
