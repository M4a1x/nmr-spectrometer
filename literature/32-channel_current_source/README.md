# 32-Channel Current Source

To drive the magnet shims, a 32-channel current source is needed. More details can be found in the [SABR magnet and shim specifications](../SABR_Permanent_Magnet_and_Shim/General%20specifications%20of%20the%20NuevoMR%20shim%20driver%20current%20source.docx)

## Ideas
- I found the [Howland current pump](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/snoa474a/snoa474a.pdf) which looks kind of like what the [Martinos Lab](https://rflab.martinos.org/index.php?title=Current_driver:Current_driver) is doing. Does this also work for our specs?
- I should probably simulate this in LT-Spice?
