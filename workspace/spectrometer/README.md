# Spectrometer

This project contains sequences to send to the marcos_server for NMR experiments.

## Notes

For analysis of later spectra:
- [`POKY`](https://github.com/pokynmr/POKY) is the successor of [SPARKY](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky) by UCSF and the [`NMRFAM-SPARKY`](https://nmrfam.wisc.edu/nmrfam-sparky-distribution/) distribution
- [`spectrochempy`](https://www.spectrochempy.fr) looks promising (only Bruker, JCAMP, OPUS, OMNIC data)
- `penguins` (reads only Bruker data?)

Other noteworthy data formats:
- [`nmrML`](https://github.com/nmrML/nmrML) open NMR data format. read supported by NMRglue
- [`JCAMP-DX`](http://www.jcamp-dx.org/) Open NMR data format. Read supported by NMRglue
