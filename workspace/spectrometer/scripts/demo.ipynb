The following cells will connect to the spectrometer, record a free induction decay (FID) and do some simple preliminary analysis. The data is stored in `nmrpipe` format, thus further analysis can be conducted in any other tooling capable of reading that format. For more features and further information, see the various record `scripts` and the library reference."
