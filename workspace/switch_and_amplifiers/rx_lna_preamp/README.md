# RX LNA Preamp

This folder contains the first amplifier in the RX chain, based on the [design of Martinos RF Lab](https://rflab.martinos.org/index.php?title=Low-noise_RF_Preamplifier) with the [PHA-13LN+](https://www.minicircuits.com/pdfs/PHA-13LN+.pdf) chip from mini-circuits.

This design could easily be adapted to be included in a All-in-one board including RX preamplifier, rx amplifier, tx amplifier, tx power amplifier and tx/rx switch.

The design was adapted using the newest KiCAD version (7.0.2, 12.05.2023).
