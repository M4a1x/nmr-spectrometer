# Red Pitaya Input Protection

The LNAs on the receive chain will amplify any signal leaked by the RF switch. The LNAs themselves are therefore protected with BAV99 diodes that clamp the voltage to roughly ~+8dBm (~1.5Vpp) and up to +10dBm (2Vpp). The input power limit for continuous waves of the PHA-13LN+ amps is +8dBm for continuous waves and +21dBm for up to 5min. Unfortunately, these specs are too high for the RF inputs of the Red Pitaya which are specified to a max of 0.5Vpp for the ADC sampling and a maximum of 1Vpp without damaging the inputs. Thus instead of using the BAV99 silicon switching diodes, diodes with a lower forward voltage - such as Schottky diodes - should be used. Simply choosing a general-purpose Schottky diode - the BYS10 in this case - led to a high attenuation of the signal of a measured ~10dB. Through a parameterized search and a SPICE simulation, the RB520SM-30 was chosen as a suitable Schottky diode, that can clamp the maximum output power of the PHA-13LN+ of about +24dBm to about +1Vpp.
